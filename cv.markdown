I am Ph.D. Graduate in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as
temporary research fellow at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of
Politecnico di Milano. My research interests include process mining,
real-time simulation in manufacturing systems, and robust optimization
for production planning and control. I love to travel and to work with
people from all over the world. I believe most of the problems can be
solved thanks to the confluence of different point of views, a proactive
attitude, and a broad-minded attitude.
